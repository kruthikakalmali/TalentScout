# AI-Powered Recruitment Platform

Our AI-powered recruitment platform revolutionizes hiring by automating initial candidate screening, intelligently ranking resumes, and conducting voice-based adaptive interviews ‚Äî all while keeping the recruiter in control through a **Human-in-the-Loop** design.

---
## Why we chose to build it?
We chose to build TalentScout because hiring today is deeply inefficient and biased. Recruiters are overwhelmed with irrelevant resumes, while great candidates are filtered out early due to resource constraints. We wanted to create a system that levels the playing field ‚Äî where AI handles the screening, interviews, and reporting, allowing recruiters to focus on what truly matters: decision-making and human connection. This solution not only solves a clear industry pain point, but also brings Responsible AI into real-world hiring processes.


## üöÄ Key Features

### üîç Smart Resume Screening

- **Resume Retrieval**: Fetches candidate resumes from **Azure Cosmos DB**.
- **Similarity Scoring**: Computes semantic similarity between resumes and job descriptions and and retrieves the top N candidates
- **Candidate Ranking**:Further using **OpenAI‚Äôs `text-embedding-ada-002`** LLM model the candidates are giving a ranking
- **Effort Reduction**: Filters out irrelevant resumes, surfacing top candidates for recruiter review.

### üéôÔ∏è Adaptive AI Interviews

Shortlisted candidates undergo an **adaptive voice-based AI screening interview** with the following capabilities:
- **Voice based interview** Enables convenience and better expression
- **Topic relevance**: The AI Interviewer has the context of the candidate's profile and the job that they are interviewing for to ask the relevant questions
- **Dynamic Questioning**: Questions adapt in real-time based on the candidate's spoken responses.
- **Topic Shifting & Difficulty Escalation**: Personalizes the interview experience to fairly assess both **technical** and **communication** skills.

### üìä Post-Interview Insights

Generates detailed interview reports using multiple AI-powered tools:

- **Transcription**: Powered by **Azure Speech Services**.
- **Audio Analysis**: Uses **Librosa** to assess vocal features like **confidence**, **calmness**, and **expressiveness**.
- **LLM-Based Evaluation**: Based on the Transcript and the audio analysis the AI agent Scores the candidates on **technical aptitude**, **clarity**, and **communication**.

These reports help recruiters make informed decisions and give high-potential candidates a fair shot ‚Äî even if their resumes fall short.
